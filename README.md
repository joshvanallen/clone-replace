# clone-replace
A simple script that allows a person to clone a repo and copy the content into another repo. An example use case for this is say you are a trainer that has a workshop that owns a repository that has all of the solutions broken up by branches or tags. You shouldn't have to expose the solutions until after the workshop is done or that particular exercise is done.
